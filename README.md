# TestData

Repository for unit-testing data and data intended to verify basic GUI plugin functionality (e.g. XPCS).

Files should generally be smaller than the GitHub file size limit (100 MB).

For larger files, we can use `git-lfs`. Impact on workflow should be minimal; just need to set up once. Optionally, `git lfs` can be used to pull in batch if there are large changes to the repo that need to be pulled down.

See https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs for a good tutorial for `git lfs` and impact on workflow.
